Its goal is to provide the reader with an understanding of the background and rationale for the project, and how the governance and process set out in the charter will deliver outcomes to the organization and other interested parties. Project charters are living documents that will be updated and changed as required. The project charter includes:\n\n- the project objectives, benefits, scope and risks;\n- the project deliverables, schedule, milestones, and estimated costs; and\n- the project organization, governance structure and stakeholders.\n\n## Section 1.

      "content": "# PROJECT OVERVIEW\n\n## Background\nBCCOHP is governed by the Health Professions Act.\n\nPursuant to s.16(2)(e) of the Health Professions Act, one of the objects of BCCOHP is “to establish and maintain a continuing competency program to promote high practice standards amongst registrants.”\n\nThe Quality Assurance (QA) Committee was established during the amalgamation of the four oral health colleges into BCCOHP on September 1, 2022. Under BCCOHP bylaw 4.09(3) the QA Committee is responsible for establishing the Quality Assurance (QA) Program referred to in s.16(2)(e) of the Health Professions Act and Part 12 of the bylaws.\n\nFollowing amalgamation of the four oral health colleges, the pre-existing QA Programs from the legacy colleges ported over to BCCOHP. As a result, there is considerable variation between the criteria, processes, and requirements for regulated Oral Health Professionals (OHPs) and each program has different internal resourcing requirements.\n\nA new QA Program is an important component of BCCOHP’s Strategic Plan. It aligns with BCCOHP’s vision and mission of reimagined oral health care oversight and regulatory leadership that collaboratively builds public confidence in the delivery of safe, ethical, and competent team based oral health care. It is also part of the strategic focus of modernized regulatory functions, specifically establishing a single QA program for all OHPs.\n\nThinking around QA programs have changed since the programs were first developed and this will give BCCOHP an opportunity to create a modern program with appropriate and accurate measurement for all OHPs. The program should aim to respect and support all members of the Oral Health Team in their pursuit of safe care and ensure patients and the public that their OHPs are safe.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has also developed new legislation which will replace the Health Professions Act. The new Health Professions and Occupations Act (HPOA) has passed Royal Assent in the BC Legislative Assembly on November 24, 2022. While the legislation has passed, the Act is not in force. However, in anticipation of the new Act, the QA Committee will take a proactive approach to align the QA Program with the forthcoming HPOA, which BCCOHP will be required to follow once enforced. Division 8 of the HPOA details requirements for the program to be proposed."
